# Credits and content licensing

The Azkar Guard **source code** is MIT-licensed (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The **content** it ships comes from the sources below, each under its own terms. The app is and must remain **free of charge**; the first source only permits free distribution.

This file records what each source allows, as checked on 2026-09-27. It is not legal advice.

## 1. Azkar text: Hisn al-Muslim (حصن المسلم)

- **What we use:** the Arabic morning and evening azkar (chapter 27), their repetition counts, and the selection itself, in `src/data/azkar.json`, copied from the [browser extension](https://github.com/azkar-guard/azkar-guard-browser-extension), where `scripts/build_azkar.py` fetches it from the [hisnmuslim.com](https://www.hisnmuslim.com) API.
- **Author:** Sheikh Sa'id bin Ali bin Wahf al-Qahtani (سعيد بن علي بن وهف القحطاني).
- **Terms:** the book's rights page (42nd edition, 1436 AH, [archive.org copy](https://archive.org/details/7sn-muslem)) says the rights are reserved for the author, except for anyone who wants to print it and distribute it free of charge, without deletion, addition or change:

  > حقوق الطبع محفوظة للمؤلف إلا لمن أراد طبعه وتوزيعه مجانًا بدون حذف أو إضافة أو تغيير

- **What this means for us:**
  - The app must stay free.
  - The Arabic text is reproduced verbatim. The only changes are Unicode NFC normalization (canonically equivalent, renders identically) and removing the counting notes, which the counter replaces.
  - The azkar themselves are Qur'an and Sunnah. The book is the reference for the selection and the counts.
  - We use one chapter rather than the whole book, and split it into cards, so this is not a full reprint. We credit the book as the source.
- **hisnmuslim.com** itself shows no license or terms of use (checked on the site and its API). Its content is the book above.

## 2. English translation of meaning: hisnmuslim.com English edition

- **What we use:** `translation_en` in `src/data/azkar.json`, taken from the English edition at `hisnmuslim.com/api/en/27.json`.
- **Edits:** inline counting notes and footnotes are removed, evening variants follow the source's own evening instructions, and plain errors are corrected (e.g. "angles" → "angels", "All-Seeing" → "All-Hearing" for السميع).
- **Credit:** hisnmuslim.com is credited here and on the settings page.
- **Terms:** hisnmuslim.com states no license for its English edition and does not name the translator. We use it on the basis that the site and the book are published for free distribution, and we credit it. We have no explicit written permission. If the rights holder objects, we will replace the text.

## 3. Transliteration

Written for this project in a consistent scheme. The source's own transliteration was used only as a reading aid. Covered by the MIT license.

## 4. Hadith excerpts: fawazahmed0/hadith-api

- **What we use:** the Arabic `virtue_note_ar` excerpts (al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud) and the al-Bukhari 6407 reminder. Each is verified verbatim at build time.
- **Source:** [github.com/fawazahmed0/hadith-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/hadith-api).
- **Terms:** [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) (public domain dedication).

## 5. Qur'an text: Tanzil Project

- **What we use:** the Qur'an verses in the motivational reminders (`src/lib/reminders.ts`), from Tanzil's *quran-simple* text via [api.alquran.cloud](https://alquran.cloud/api).
- **Terms:** CC BY 3.0 with Tanzil's conditions. Verbatim copies only (changing the text is not allowed), the source must be clearly indicated, and there must be a link to tanzil.net. The page footer and the settings page carry the attribution and the link. The required notice:

## 6. Prayer times: adhan-js

- **What we use:** [adhan-js](https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-js) by Batoul Apps (v4.4.6) calculates Fajr and Maghrib on the user's device.
- **Terms:** MIT License.
- **Method parameters:** the methods adhan-js doesn't ship (Gulf, France, Russia, JAKIM, Tunisia, Algeria, Kemenag, Morocco, Jordan) are defined from the parameters [AlAdhan](https://aladhan.com) publishes at `/v1/methods`. AlAdhan's times are also the test reference (`src/lib/fixtures/aladhan.json`, recorded once by the VS Code extension's `scripts/build_aladhan_fixtures.mjs`). The app itself never calls AlAdhan.

## 7. Cities: GeoNames

- **What we use:** `src/data/cities.json`, with cities of 100,000+ people and every capital, their coordinates, and Arabic and English names. Copied from the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/azkar-guard/azkar-guard-vscode-extension), where `scripts/build_locations.py` generates it from [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org) `cities15000`, `countryInfo` and `alternateNamesV2`.
- **Terms:** [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Credited here and on the settings page.

## 8. Time zones: IANA tz database

- **What we use:** `src/data/timezones.json`, the principal-city coordinates of each time zone (`zone.tab`, `backward`, `iso3166.tab`), used to suggest a location from the device's time zone.
- **Terms:** public domain.
